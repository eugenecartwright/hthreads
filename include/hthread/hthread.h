  * \brief      The declaration of the Hybrid Threads API.

  *
  * This file contains the declaration of the Hybrid Threads API.
  * Hybrid Threads is a threading library for embedded systems which
  * is similar in functionality to PThreads. However, the thread
  * management for Hybrid Threads is done in hardware on an FPGA.
  *
  * This frees the processor so that it only performs meaningful
  * computations. The overhead from the use of threading is reduced
  * to a simple context switch.
