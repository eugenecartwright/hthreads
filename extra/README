Extra Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains extra tools which are used during the Hthreads build
process. The tool in this directory are developed independent of the Hthreads
process and each of them have their own licensing agreements. Please read each
licensing agreement carefully before installing.

FT-Jam (http://freetype.sourceforge.net/jam/index.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jam is a small open-source build tool that can be used as a replacement for
Make. Even though Jam is a lot simpler to use than Make, it is far more
powerful and easy to master. It already works on a large variety of platforms
(Unix, Windows, OS/2, VMS, MacOS, BeOS, etc.), it is trivial to port, and its
design is sufficiently clear to allow any average programmer to extend it with
advanced features at will.

The main differences between Jam and Make are as follows.
    * Jam uses ‘Jamfiles’ instead of ‘Makefiles’.
    * Jamfiles do not normally contain toolset-specific rules or actions.
      They are thus portable among distinct compilers.
    * Jamfiles are a lot simpler than Makefiles to write and understand,
      while providing the same functionality, and much, much more.

There are currently two versions of Jam available.
    * The classic Jam, which is available, with documentation, from the official
      Jam homepage at Perforce, the original Jam author.
    * An improved version, named ‘FT Jam’, containing several enhancements
      (like the ability to run on Windows 9x systems, or additional
      compiler/toolset support).

LibNET (http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application programmer to
construct and inject network packets. It provides a portable and simplified
interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet
hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application programmer
such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information,
byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet features portable
packet creation interfaces at both the IP-layer and link-layer, as well as a
host of supplementary and complementary functionality. Using libnet, quick and
simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with little effort. With
a bit more time, more complex programs can be written (Traceroute and Ping were
easily rewritten using libnet and libpcap).

Libnet was designed and is primarily maintained by Mike D. Schiffman (mike at
infonexus dot com) and a host of other people (please see the libnet
documentation for the complete list of contributers).
