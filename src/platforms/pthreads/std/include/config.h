/** \file       config.h
  * \brief      Configuration parameters used for the hybrid threads system.
  *
  * \author     Wesley Peck <peckw@ittc.ku.edu>\n
  *
  * This file contains the configuration parameters used by the system.
  * In this file the parameters are hardcoded because no actual hardware
  * exists. This is done so that some host tools which calculate hardware
  * addresses will still work.
  *
  * In addition, some of the values in this file are used to make PThreads
  * more accurately emulate Hthreads. The value of MUTEX_BITS, for example,
  * is used to determine how many mutexes are allocated by the system.
