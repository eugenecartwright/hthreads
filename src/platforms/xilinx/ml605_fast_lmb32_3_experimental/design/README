In order to aid in platform building automation and to simplify
manual platform building, a script is included within this 
particular platform. The files, build_system.tcl and
build_system.sh should be portable across current versions
of XPS.

In order to build this platform, users should make sure the
build_system.sh file has executable permissions. (Optional) Modify
the last line of build_system.sh in order to download directly
to the board when done.
