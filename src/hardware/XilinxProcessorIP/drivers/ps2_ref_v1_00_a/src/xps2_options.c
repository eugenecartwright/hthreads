* This function returns the last errors that have occurred in the specified
* PS/2 port. It also clears the errors such that they cannot be retrieved again.
* The errors include parity error, receive overrun error, framing error, and
* break detection.
*
* The last errors is an accumulation of the errors each time an error is
* discovered in the driver. A status is checked for each received byte and
* this status is accumulated in the last errors.
*
* If this function is called after receiving a buffer of data, it will indicate
* any errors that occurred for the bytes of the buffer. It does not indicate
* which bytes contained errors.
*
* @param    InstancePtr is a pointer to the XPs2 instance to be worked on.
*
* @return
*
* The last errors that occurred. The errors are bit masks that are contained
* in the file xps2.h and named XPS2_ERROR_*.
*
* @note
*
* None.
