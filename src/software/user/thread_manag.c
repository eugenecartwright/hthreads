  *
  * This file contains implementation of the thread management functions
  * for the Hybrid Threads API. Hybrid Threads is a threading library for
  * embedded systems which is similar in functionality to PThreads. However,
  * the management of most functionality in Hybrid Threads is done in hardware
  * on an FPGA. This frees the processor so that it only performs meaningful
  * computations. The overhead from the use of threading is reduced
  * to a simple context switch.
