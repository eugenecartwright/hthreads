/** \brief  Associate a thread with an interrupt.
  *
  * \author Wesley Peck <peckw@eecs.ku.edu>
  *
  * This function will associate a thread with and interrupt so that the thread
  * will not run again until the interrupt has occurred. This function call
  * will block the calling thread until the interrupt that was associated with
  * has fired.
  *
  * \param iid      This parameter is the interrupt number of the interrupt
  *                 to associate the calling thread with.
  * \return         The return value is one of the following:
  *                 - HTHREAD_SUCCESS\n
  *                     The thread has successfully been associated with
  *                     the given interrupt number.
  *                 - HTHREAD_FAILURE\n
  *                     The thread could not be associated with the given
  *                     interrupt number.
