1. Figure out how to initialize thread table before jumping to int main()
   a) extern thread table, 
   b) jump to it from .S file, 
   c)guard it using #ifdef for non-heterogeneous applications

2. Move stack (and heap) into local BRAM for host

3. Merge changes with Alborz's directory

4. Determine how to remove the #ifdef HETERO_COMPILATION completely. 

5. Fetch lscript for host automatically, (check hcompile for commented code).
   You do this for the slaves. The lscript that we use for the host may be
   customized and probably cannot use the default lscript that SDK generates.
   This is probably why you have the code commented out.
