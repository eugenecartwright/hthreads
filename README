Hybridthreads v0.5.0 - Prerequisites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hthreads system depends on the following tools during the build process.
    * Xilinx ISE (http://www.xilinx.com)
        This is required to build the Hthreads system for target systems
        which include Xilinx based FPGAs

    * Xilinx EDK (http://www.xilinx.com)
        This is required to build the Hthreads system for target systems
        which include Xilinx based FPGAs

    * PowerPC Cross Compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org)
        This is required to build the Hthreads system for target systems
        which are based on the PowerPC processor. 

    * Jam Build System (http://freetype.sourceforge.net/jam/index.html)
        This is required to build the Hthreads system. A free distribution
        of Jam named FT-Jam can be found in the "extra" directory of the
        Hthreads distribution.
    
    * Libnet (http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/)
        This is required to build several of the host tools supplied
        with the Hthreads system. A BSD licensed distribution of
        Libnet can be found in the "extra" directory of the Hthreads
        distribution.

    * Libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
        This is required for several of the host tools supplied with
        the Hthreads system. This is usually obtained with your
        operating system.

    * Libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org/)
        This is required for several of the host tools supplied with
        the Hthreads system. This is usually obtained with your
        operating system.

    * Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
        This is required to build the documentation for the Hthreads
        system. This is a commonly used code documentation tool and
        it not included with the distribution.

The Hthreads system is only tested on the following target systems:
    * Xilinx Virtex-5 Pro ML507
    * Xilinx Virtex-6 Pro ML605
    * Xilinx Virtex-II Pro ML310
    * Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XUP

In addition, the following host systems have been used:
    * Redhat Enterprise Linux 3.0
    * Redhat Enterprise Linux 5.0
    * CentOS 5.8
    * Ubuntu 10.04

If you have success in using the Hthreads system on other systems please
contact the Hthreads group at hthreads@ittc.ku.edu.


Hybridthreads v0.5.0 - Installation Procedures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hthreads system does not install any files on the host operating system.
When building Hthreads a set of executable files are created for the target
system. These executables are meant to be downloaded to the target system and
executed there.

Hybridthreads v0.5.0 - Build Procedures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the Hthreads system simply invoke the jam build system from the top
level directory. This command will recurse through the Hthreads source tree and
build the entire system. An example is given below:
    > jam

The Hthreads build process uses a set of configuration files to control the
build process. These user modifiable files are located in "config". The file
"settings" contains most of the user modifiable build parameters. Another file
"common" also resides in this directory. The contents of this file do not
normally need to be modified.

Once the build process has been complete there will be two additional
directories in the top level of the Hthreads source tree: "lib" and "test". The
lib directory contains the Hthreads library that can be linked against to
create executables.  The test directory contains all of the pre-built
executables for the target system. These executables can be downloaded to the
target system and executed.

In addition to this, many host tool will be built and installed into "bin".
Please look at the README in the "bin" directory to learn more about the host
tools.
